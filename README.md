## üöÄ Usage

To launch the `armando_display.launch.py` file run the armando_display.launch.py file to visualize the robot in Rviz:

```bash
ros2 launch armando_description armando_display.launch.py
```

Run the armando_world.launch.py file to visualize the robot in Gazebo and set the choice_controll argument to start the desired controller:

* choice_controll = 0: starts the position_controller.

* choice_controll = 1: starts the joint_trajectory_controller.


To launch the position_controller, execute:

```bash
ros2 launch armando_gazebo armando_world.launch.py choice_controll:=0
```

To launch the joint_trajectory_controller, execute:

```bash
ros2 launch armando_gazebo armando_world.launch.py choice_controll:=1
```

To view which controllers are currently active, run the rqt_controller_manager tool in a separate terminal (first-time users should install it):

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt-controller-manager
ros2 run rqt_controller_manager rqt_controller_manager
```
Finally, to verify that the image topic is correctly published, use rqt_image_view:

```bash
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```
